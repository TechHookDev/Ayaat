Ayaat v1.0.9 - The "Surgical Precision" Update

This update introduces a fundamental overhaul of the reading experience, focusing on extreme performance and guaranteed navigation accuracy.

🚀 PERFORMANCE & SMOOTHNESS
- Restored High-Performance ListView engine: Opening large Surahs (like Al-Baqarah) is now instant and lag-free.
- Massive Cache Buffer: Implemented cacheExtent optimization to pre-render verses, ensuring buttery-smooth scrolling even on older devices.
- Zero-Stutter Transitions: Optimized the rendering pipeline with RepaintBoundaries for a professional, native feel.

🎯 SURGICAL NAVIGATION
- Direct-Offset Engine: Replaced estimated scrolling with a deterministic "Surgical" calculation. The app now measures the exact pixel height of every preceding verse for a 100% accurate landing.
- Phase-Sync Smoothness: "Continue Reading" now glides gracefully to the target Ayah without any visual jumps or polling stutters.
- Premium Animated Highlights: Target verses now glow into focus with a refined, subtle shadow animation.

🧹 MINIMALIST UI & POLISH
- Clean Surah List: Removed Ayah counts ("286 Verses") from the main list for a more elegant, minimalist aesthetic.
- Global Roman Numerals: Standardized all numbering (1, 2, 3) across all languages.
- Auto-Sync Versioning: The About page now automatically keeps in sync with the app manifest.
- Language Refinements: Polished translations for Arabic, English, and French across all settings.

May this update bring you closer to the Book of Allah. Please remember us in your prayers.
